# Rule-change 322

Proposed by Alfie/Alfie275

```
Amend rule 201 to "If the Online State of the game is 'false', players shall alternate in the order that their names appear on the official list of players, taking one turn-part apiece in the order they are specified in the definition of a turn. A player must perform the same turn-part as the prior player unless they are the first player on the official list of players, in which case the player moves onto the next turn part.
If the Online State of the game is 'true', players shall take one turn-part per round, each round ending when all players have taken a turn-part. For a given round, every player will take the same turn-part. The turn-part for a given round follows that of the previous round in the order specified in the definition of a turn."
