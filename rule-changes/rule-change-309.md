# Rule-change 309

Proposed by Michael/barrucadu

> Amend rule 201 to "Players shall alternate in the order that their names appear on the official list of players, taking one turn-part apiece in the order they are specified in the definition of a turn. A player must perform the same turn-part as the prior player unless they are the first player on the official list of players, in which case the player moves onto the next turn part."
