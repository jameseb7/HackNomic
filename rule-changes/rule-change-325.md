# Rule-change 325

Proposed by James/jameseb

> Amend Rule 212 to "At any time a player may make a Call For Judgement (CFJ), asking a question about the interpretation of the rules or the state of the game. When a player makes a CFJ, the CFJ is assigned an identification number (starting from 1), that player becomes the Invoker of that CFJ and the player preceding them on the official list of players (looping to the end of the list if they are the first player on the list) becomes the Judge of that CFJ.
>
> The Judge must then present a Judgement for that CFJ to the players, providing an answer to the question asked along with reasoning for why they deem it the correct answer.
>
> The non-Judge players must then vote on the Judge's Judgement. If a majority of the non-abstaining non-Judge players vote in favour of the Judge's Judgement, the CFJ is resolved and the Judgement is taken to be a true answer to the question asked, given the state of the game at the time the CFJ was made, and the state of the game shall alter to reflect the Judgement. If a majority of the non-abstaining non-Judge players do not vote in favour of the Judge's Judgement, the Judge is overruled and the player preceding the overruled Judge on the official list of players (looping to the beginning if the Judge was the first player on the list and ignoring the Invoker) becomes the new Judge of the CFJ. The resolution of the CFJ then continues starting from the second paragraph of this rule with the new Judge.
>
> New Judges are not bound by the decisions of overruled Judges. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider previous non-overruled Judgements, game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards."
